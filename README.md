# Origin

This library was forked when it used to exist on Google Code only. In the meantime the original author moved the code to github as well ([DimitrisAndreou/memory-measurer](https://github.com/DimitrisAndreou/memory-measurer)), however it appears that the library is not actively maintained any more.
